# jot

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

Minimal opinionated Python CLI to jot timestamped thoughts.

## Install

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
2. Run `uv tool install git+https://github.com/matt-dray/jot` in a terminal.

## Use

Open a terminal and write a jotting:

```bash
jot "ate an apple"
```

The first time you run `jot`, you'll be prompted for a path to a text file where your jottings will be written. The (resolved, absolute and POSIX-standardised) file path will be stored under the `JOT_PATH` key in a `jot_config.json` file saved to your computer's home folder.

Each jotting is prepended to the text file in the form `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] ate an apple`.
